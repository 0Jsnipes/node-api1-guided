# Hubs Web API

Guided project for **Web API I** module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and cover the basics of `server-side routing` and using global `middleware`.

The code for the guided project will be written in a single file for simplicity. We'll see ways to structure an API to make it more maintainable in upcoming lectures.

## Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Starter Code

The starter code for this example is configured to run the server by typing `yarn server` or `npm run server`. The server will restart automatically on changes.

Data for the API will be stored in memory using an array.

Follow along as the intstructor walks you through building the API.
